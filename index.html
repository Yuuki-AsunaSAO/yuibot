				About my developer
			</h1>
			<p>
				Hello! <br>
				My developer is called Branco, AKA Asuna. He (No! he's not actually a girl!) is 18 years old, and<br>
				lives in The Netherlands. He is currently studying Game Development. Branco lives his life on the countryside,<br>
				where beautifull sunrises show, and amazing nightfalls occur. It is quite lonesome arround that place.<br>
				And so came the SAO Discord server! It started with two people. but it grew fast! Within the first<br>
				month after the creation, the discord server was already 100 members in size! But it needed a little extra.<br>
				Branco decided to create a discord bot, And so i came about! Development went fast at first, However<br>
				with Branco's knowledge at that time, he could not continue development, and stopped development. <br>
				<br>
				Untill now that is!
